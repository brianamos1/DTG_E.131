# DTG_E131
This project allows E1.31 data to be sent to and interpreted by a teensy 4.1. 

This was specifically designed to work with the duotrigesimalWS2811 board, however that is not required. It is recommended that the varibles mentioned at the begining of the sketch be altered where they sit in the code to reflect real world conditions.


For example, if you are only using 10 pins for output, the pinout list should only have the 10 pins you are using listed. They should be listed in sequential universe order, not necessarily the sequential pin order.
